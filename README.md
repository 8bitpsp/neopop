New Features
------------

#### Version 0.71.15 (September 30 2007)

*   Fixed crash caused by having many long filenames in the same directory

Installation
------------

Unzip `neopop.zip` into `/PSP/GAME/` folder on the memory stick.

Game ROMâ€™s can reside anywhere (the GAMES subdirectory is recommended, but not necessary). NeoPop PSP supports ROM loading from ZIP files.

Controls
--------

During emulation:

| PSP controls                    | Emulated controls            |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Analog stick up/down/left/right | D-pad up/down/left/right     |
| D-pad up/down/left/right        | D-pad up/down/left/right     |
| [ ] (square)                    | Button A                     |
| X (cross)                       | Button B                     |
| Select                          | Option                       |
| [L] + [R]                       | Return to the emulator menu  |

By default, button configuration changes are not retained after button mapping is modified. To save changes, press X (cross) after desired mapping is configured. To load the default mapping press ^ (triangle).
